# LetsMakeAGame

Making games is one of the most productive ways to becoming a better problem solver. Even a simple game requires you to think critically and learn something new. I enjoy the process of making games and would like to share with you how I make simple games and my thought process behind them!   
Each folder contains a game and a README that links to a blog post about the game I made. You can follow along or take a game and improve on it and make it your own! This is why making games is so much fun!  
I use whatever technology I think would be best to build a game. Most of the time I use JavaScript and HTML canvas, though thatâ€™s not guaranteed. This is an ongoing project to help keep my skills sharp, help people make some games and have some fun along
